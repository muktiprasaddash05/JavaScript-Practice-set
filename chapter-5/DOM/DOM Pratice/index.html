      There was once a velveteen rabbit, and in the beginning he was really
      splendid. He was fat and bunchy, as a rabbit should be; his coat was
      spotted brown and white, he had real thread whiskers, and his ears were
      lined with pink sateen. On Christmas morning, when he sat wedged in the
      top of the Boy’s stocking, with a sprig of holly between his paws, the
      effect was charming. There were other things in the stocking, nuts and
      oranges and a toy engine, and chocolate almonds and a clockwork mouse, but
      the Rabbit was quite the best of all. For at least two hours the Boy loved
      him, and then Aunts and Uncles came to dinner, and there was a great
      rustling of tissue paper and unwrapping of parcels, and in the excitement
      of looking at all the new presents the Velveteen Rabbit was forgotten.
