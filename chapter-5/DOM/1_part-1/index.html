      <h1 id="headline" class="country">The Silly Chicken By Idries Shah</h1>
      <p id="story2">
        A delightful and humorous tale about a chicken who learns to speak as we
        do. What follows will intrigue young children and, at the same time,
        alert them in a very amusing way to the dangers of being too gullible.
        This is illustrator/animator Jeff Jackson’s first children’s book. It
        expresses his unique ability to create a lively and amusing world, rich
        in color and in which anything can happen.
